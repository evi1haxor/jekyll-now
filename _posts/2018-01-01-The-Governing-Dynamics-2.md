#### Long time no see master Jiraiya!
Well, I've been reading the lectures by Sir, Richard Feynman on Quantum electrodynamics lately. Astound to know the grotesque behaviour of light and matter! So I thought why not summarising what I got in a sub-series of blog posts under *The Governing Dynamics*. Now then, let's start the New Year with the grace of peculiarities of holy **light**. So, as James Buchan mentioned in his book *As easy as π*

> So here we go from 0 to ∞ via Amazonian tribes, drug culture and nuclear paranoia.

# Evolution of revolution- QED
In physics, it's a common question about unification of different theories. Afterall, it makes the analysis easier. Otherwise, there would have been plentiful explanation even for a simple observation or experiment. For eliminating inappropriate or cumbersome theories and arguments, there are some tools philosophy serves with; what they call, *the razors* (My personal favourite is Newton's flaming laser sword!). They all have their own technicalities, but the basis is simple- what sounds easier, and have more arguments should be considered over the one which has got fewer assertions.

For example, previously, motion, sound, gravitation, heat, light and optics all were dealt with different theories and reasoning. But no sooner than when Newton came up with the Laws of motion, motion, heat and sound were firstly explained under a single theory. With Newton's breakthrough of these governing laws, the results apparantly explained well the phenomenon of sound and heat. Then we were left with the laws of motion, phenomenon of light and optics, and phenomenon of gravitation. (The theory of gravitation still stands isolated!). Later phenomenon of magnetism and electricity were explained under a simplified theory- electromagnetism (Blame: Sir, James Clerk Maxwell), which proposes that light is an electromagnetic wave.

When theory was developed about the matter, they didn't happen to get the idea using simple classical model down on electrons. They encountered a significant disparity between the experiments and calculations. Meanwhile, evolution of the structure of an atom was onto Schrödinger's equation(uncorrected). But Schrödinger's work wasn't much reliable for complex structures until Paul Dirac made some modifications in the equation using results of theory of relativity. And guess what he got!?! The intrinsic angular momentum of electron as an additional quantum number with other 3. He claimed that electrons are like tiny magnets in themselves (tho these analogies has nothing to do with real life perception..they are *intrinsic*). And the correction made not only tally with the behaviour of electrons in an atom, but in multi-nuclear molecules too- Using Lenear combination of atomic orbitals and [Oppenheimer approximation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born–Oppenheimer_approximation).

# QED
**Q E D**! The *Quantum Realm of electronic interaction*!
It wasn't an easy task to calculate stuff at quantum level. The problem of the calculation in QED was straightened out by three Nobel prize winners, 1965- Feynman, Schwinger, Tomonaga. They, along with associated apprentices, developed the most veracious and crisp theory till date the mankind have ever made. Just for sake of giving an idea, Feynman says- *"If you were to measure the distance from Los Angeles to New York to this accuracy, it would be exact to the thickness of a human hair.  That's how delicately Quantum electrodynamics has in the past 50 years being checked- both theoretically and experimentally"*

Then he adds..

> I would like to again impress you with the vast range of phenomena that theory of quantum electrodynamics describes: It's easy to say it backwards: The theory describe all the phenomena of the physical world except the gravitation effect, the thing that holds you in your seat (actually that's a combination of gravity and politeness, I think) and radioactive phenomena which involves nuclei shifting in their energy levels. So if we leave out gravity and radioactivity (more properly, nuclear physics) what have we got left? Gasoline burning in automobiles, forms and bubbles hardness of salt or copper, the stiffness of Steel. In fact biologist are trying to interpret as much as they can about life in terms of Chemistry and as I already explained that theory behind chemistry is quantum electrodynamics.

## Feynman's Approach
The theory is a skilful attempt of showing the nature and behaviour of electrons at the quantum scale, into a clever arrangement of mathematical terms. Most of the time people don't see the significance of that mathematics until shown the [Feynman's diagram](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram). Feynman diagram is an interactive way to put the behaviour of subatomic particles in a simple caricature. Every diagram represents an equation.

If we take a simple experiment of scattering of two electrons..

--You're expected to know about the [Exchange force and Exchange Particles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_force)--


Even in such a simple experiment there can be infinite possibilities for the way gluon exchange occur within the quantum field. Some of the important possibilities are..

*Each dot pair connection represents one photon transfer*

Though this process of transfer of photons is painstaking. This makes it easier to perceive the maximum probability contributor among all. All we need to do is count the number of dots, lesser the dots, more is the probability amplitude ("Probability amplitude?" You ask; Well, if you've read the Schrödinger's wave equation, you might have encountered with the complex numbers written in bra-ket notation like <Φ|Ψ>..here, the bra-ket i.e. left and right, represents the probability amplitude. Squaring the modulus of these complex numbers gives the probability of occurrence of Φ event or Ψ event)

### The Physics!

Most the time QED turns into hardcore mathematical analysis. It takes physics students itself to comprehend it completely in years! At this he said..

> "So now you know what I’m going to talk about. The next question is, will you understand what I’m going to tell you? Everybody who comes to a scientific lecture knows they are not going to understand it, but maybe the lecturer has a nice, colored tie to look at. Not in this case! (Feynman is not wearing a tie.)
> What I am going to tell you about is what we teach our physics students in the third or fourth year of graduate school—and you think I’m going to explain it to you so you can understand it? No, you’re not going to be able to understand it. Why, then, am I going to bother you with all this? Why are you going to sit here all this time, when you won’t be able to understand what I am going to say? It is my task to convince you not to turn away because you don’t understand it. You see, my physics students don’t understand it either. That is because I don’t understand it. Nobody does."

Feynman always has some captivating version of even the boring ideas!

Well, you may like to have some self reading of the topic. It's tedious task to explain every bit of it here, so it would be better to do so..I insist!

Heil Evi1haxor!
