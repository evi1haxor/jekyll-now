title: Why the way it is, the Way it is?!

Such an accident that we happened to happen! Sometimes I use to think about the way everything is, and I suspend in the zero; in a sensible world full of nonsense yet with sense! Believe it..!

Recently I read an article claiming that the Three Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula been disrupted by the flairs associated with nearby tremendous explosion. Though, the affect is not yet visible from the earth, as an estimate they said probably in 1000 years or so it will be visible from the earth. Ah! The Pillars of Creation! But now ceases to be some. Couldn't even secure its own beingness! 

This made me wonder, through what conditions and circumstances the particle that makes us today has gone through. Hitherto making something like us! Humans! Intelligent enough to explore the reason of its own existence..

## Swirling back in time time time time...

Since the time human consciousness has became independent, it started questioning. Questioning about How? Why? When? Where?.. among all, the question which baffled him the most- "How all of it started in the first place?". Different theories were put and repudiated. And now, The Big Bang Theory is globally accepted. Moreover, the after-heat of this enormous event have been detected not long ago- [Cosmic Microwave Background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background)
The event, to the best of the knowledge at the moment, occured 13.8 billion years ago. Everything! Everything that you can spot nearby or aloofed, even everything else which you cannot spot, even the energy you're consuming to read this snippet (hopefully) ALL of it happened to, apparantly, pop up into existence from a pin point 13.8 billion years ago! Oh! Does it sound like *last 13.8 billion yearism* like *last Thursdayism*, if it does, let me be sorry for miscommunication..
Whatsoever you see, didn't just showed up on clarion call. It took painstaking efforts in the name of time, that this intricate gravel we see today is the way, the way it is.

Just after the big bang, nothing was stable. not even a photon was there, neither anything featuring some negatively charged particles shackled around an equally positively charge particle now known as atom of some element. Gradually surroundings ebbed, surging electrons captured by the proton. Thenceforth, formed first stable atom of hydrogen. The atoms started to drawn to each other making large and dense clound clusters. Density that Helium atoms started to form. Now clounds had hydrogen and helium. These clouds eventually started getting denser and denser, untill get so hot, that nuclear reactions started to occur. Therefrom, first star was born! Stars, formed...presto they go nova! These were massive and short lived. They used to collect so much matter that they went so massive and dense that they eventually explode and sprew themselves out loud! Early universe was occupied by this cycle of star formation and novae. But this cumbersome didn't go idle. this was the period when elements like carbon, silicon, sulphur, nitrogen and other not-so-predominant(on cosmic perspective) elements formed. These elements formed rocks, ice chunks which we see in comets now, and other molecules.
As the universe expanded, this rigorous cycle of star formation and explosion slowed down. Stars, now tend to live longer that the early universe. 

I can go on and on and on...in a single post already! So I think I should desist this post to stockpile some content for my future post  :simple_smile:

The earth have been the shore to us beyond which lay a vast and antique cosmic ocean, full of mysteries which beckons. And as Carl Sagan said..

> "Recently we've waded our ankles. The water seems inviting. The ocean calls. Some part of our being knows this from where we came. We long to return. These aspirations are not, I think, irrelevant although, they may trouble whatever god may be."
